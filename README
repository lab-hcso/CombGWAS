Getting started

Infer_Summary_Statistics_for_Comorbidity_and_Single_disorder could be utilized to infer to summary statistics of 
comorbid disorders or only single disorder based on the summary statistics of corresponding traits. The proposed 
approach is based on publicly available GWAS summary statistics. Since the effect size of individual SNPs in 
different GWAS may not correspond to the same allele, we need to integrate GWAS summary statistics from different 
sources first, which could be realized by Make_Harmon_data.R.

We can use Get_Summary_Statistics_for_Comorbidity() and Get_Summary_Statistics_for_Only_Single_Trait() to infer the
summary statistics of comorbid disorders or only single disorder based on the summary statistics of corresponding traits.
To realize this, we need to provide the following information about the involved traits:
# Description of input parameters
# harmon_data: harmonized summary statistics for two traits derived from TwosampleMR
# Size_TraitA: Sample size of trait A
# Size_TraitB: Sample size of trait B
# TraitA_preval: Disease prevalence of trait A
# TraitB_preval: Disease prevalence of trait B
# Comorbid_preval: Disease prevalence of comorbid trait
# LDSR_intercept : LD score regression intercept  

These two functions can also applied to clinically defined categories of quantitative traits. To realize this, we need to 
transform coefficients derived from linear regression (continuous trait as outcome)to coefficients from logistic regression 
(binary trait as outcome). This transformation can be realzied through Get_summary_statistics_for_clinically_defined_categories.R. 
This file include two functions, which could be used to transform beta and se derived from linear regression that from logistic 
regression. To these two transformation functions in R file, we need to provide the following information about the studied 
quantitative trait:
# Description of input parameters
# beta_cont: beta derived from linear regression
# se_cont: se derived from linear regression
# mean_trait: mean value of the studied quantitative trait  (in original scale)
# sd_trait: standard deviation of the studied quantitative trait (in original scale)
# thres_raw: cut-off for the studied quantitative trait (in original scale)
# eaf: effect allele frequency
# standardized_y: TRUE/FALSE; does the GWAS summary statistics refer to a quantitative trait already standardized?



1. System requirement
   1) Operating system: Linux, MacOS, Windows.
   2) Dependencies(R packages):locfdr,sfsmisc,msm,rootSolve,numDeriv,mvtnorm and mvtnorm.
   3) R versions: no specific requirement as long as the dependent R packages are accessible.
   4) Other requirements: None.
   Notes: These two functions have been tested on different R versions and operating systems, i.e., R version 3.4.4
   (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)) and R version 3.6.3(x86_64-apple-darwin15.6).
   
2. User guidance
   You can directly download the functions to your local depository for usage. In order to use the these functions,you will 
   need to install the dependent R packages first, i.e.,TwoSampleMR,locfdr,sfsmisc,msm,rootSolve,numDeri and mvtnorm. Sample
   sizes of corresponding traits can be directly extracted from the corresponding research where the GWAS study of studied 
   trait was performed. LDSR_intercept could be calculated by LD score regression (LDSR)(https://github.com/bulik/ldsc) based
   on the summary statistics of two studied traits.
   
3. Demo
   We provide toy examples and demo code to demonstrate how to use the code for the inference of summary statistics for comorbid
   disorder or only single disorder under the directory of Example. For more details, please refer to Example/Demo.R
